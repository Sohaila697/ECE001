		            <p>The Android operating system is most frequently used on different mobile platforms around the world. It is occupied approximately 75% of shares in the worldwide market by the end of 2020. A company like Open Handset Alliance has developed the first Android that depends on the customized version of the Linux kernel as well as other open-source software. At the initial stage of 2005, Google sponsored the project &amp; it obtained the entire company. In September 2008, the first Android device was released in the market to dominate the mobile industries due to several features like user friendly, the support of the community is huge, customization, manufacturing of android devices in large companies. Consequently, the market examines the demand to develop Android-supported devices with smart developers. So, the Android operating system became a complete set of operating systems for different devices like wearables, mobiles, notebooks, smart TVs, tablets, set-top boxes, etc.</p>
		            <h2>What is an Android Operating System?</h2>

		            </p>
		            <p>Android development supports the full java programming language. Even other packages that are API and JSE are not supported. The first version 1.0 of the android development kit (SDK) was released in 2008 and the latest updated version is a jelly bean.</p>
		            <h3>Features of Android Operating System</h3>
		            <p>The unique features/<strong>characteristics of the android operating system</strong>&nbsp;include the following.</p>
		            <ul>
		              <li>Near Field Communication (NFC)</li>
		              <li>Alternate Keyboards</li>

		              <li>Optimized graphics</li>
	                </ul>
		            <h3>Android Architecture</h3>
		            <p>The android is an operating system and is a stack of software components which is divided into five sections and four main layers that is</p>
		            <ul>
		              <li>Linux kernel</li>
		              <li>Libraries</li>
		              <li>Android runtime</li>
		              <li>Application Framework</li>
		              <li>Applications</li>
	                </ul>
		            <p><img src="images/Android-Architecture.png" width="592" height="416"></p>
<h4>Linux Kernel</h4>
		            <p>The android uses the powerful Linux kernel and it supports a wide range of hardware drivers. The kernel is the heart of the operating system that manages input and output requests from the software. This provides basic system functionalities like process management, memory management, device management like camera, keypad, display, etc the kernel handles all the things.</p>
		            <p>Linux is really good at networking and it is not necessary to interface it to the peripheral hardware. The kernel itself does not interact directly with the user but rather interacts with the shell and other programs as well as with the hardware devices on the system.</p>
		            <h4>Libraries</h4>
		            <p>The on top of a Linux kennel there is a set of libraries including open-source web browsers such as WebKit, library libc. These libraries are used to play and record audio and video. The SQLite is a database that is useful for the storage and sharing of application data. The SSL libraries are responsible for internet security etc.</p>
		            <h4>Android Runtime</h4>
		            <p>The android runtime provides a key component called Dalvik Virtual Machine which is a kind of java virtual machine. It is specially designed and optimized for android. The Dalvik VM is the process virtual machine in the android operating system. It is software that runs apps on android devices.</p>
		            <p>The Dalvik VM makes use of Linux core features like memory management and multithreading which is in java language. The Dalvik VM enables every Android application to run its own process. The Dalvik VM &nbsp;executes the files in the .dex format.</p>
		            <h4>Application Framework</h4>
		            <p>The application framework layer provides many higher-level services to applications such as windows manager, view system, package manager, resource manager, etc. The application developers are allowed to make use of these services in their applications.</p>
		            <h4>Applications</h4>
		            <p>You will find all the android applications at the top layer and you will write your application and install it on this layer. Examples of such applications are contacts, books, browsers, services, etc. Each application performs a different role in the overall applications.</p>
		            <h3>Android Emulator</h3>
		            <p>The Emulator is a new application in the Android operating system. The emulator is a new prototype that is used to develop and test android applications without using any physical device.</p>
		            <p><img src="images/Android-Emulator-300x199.png" width="300" height="199"></p>
		            <p>The android emulator has all of the hardware and software features like mobile devices except phone calls. It provides a variety of navigation and control keys. It also provides a screen to display your application. The emulators utilize the android virtual device configurations. Once your application is running on it, it can use services of the android platform to help other applications, access the network, play audio, video, store, and retrieve the data.</p>
		            <h3>Android Versions</h3>
		            <p>The different&nbsp;<strong>android versions</strong>&nbsp;from the beginning to the present are mentioned below from 1.0 to 2.0. Here is the&nbsp;<strong>android operating system list</strong>.</p>
